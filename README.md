# The Open Penetration Testing Bookmarks Collection (handy websites for hackers)
hacker bookmark websites
...is just that, a collection of handy bookmarks I initially collected that aid me in my day to day work or I find in the course of research. They are not all inclusive and some sections need to be parsed but they are all good reference materials. I find having this Hackery folder in Firefox an easy way to reference syntax, tricks, methods, and generally facilitate and organize research.

Opening it up to everyone will facilitate a knowledge transfer. Hopefully the initial set will grow and expand.
